Crawling the web
----------------

1. Simple python web crawler<br/>
   Takes a seed URL and number of URLs to crawl as inputs and starts crawling from seed. This isn't the most efficient implementation and it might take a few seconds to spit out the result.<br/>
   <br/>
   Please note that the output is not formatted well; in fact it's ugly as hell.<br/>

   Packages used - BeautifulSoup4, requests<br/>
   <code>pip install --user beautifulsoup4</code><br/>
   <code>pip install --user requests</code>
